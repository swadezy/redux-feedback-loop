# Project Name

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a feedback submission app using redux and routing.  In order to solve this, I created separate components for each feedback question and buttons for the user to navigate forwards and backwards throughout the app.  Additionally, this feedback is stored in a database on submission, which can be accessed by navigating to /admin (or by clicking the admin button I put in app for my own navigation and troubleshooting).  From this admin page, the user can flag submitted feedbacks for further review or delete feedback items.
